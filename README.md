# DATA-PREPROCESSING-FOR-CUSTOMER-INFORMATION
A CSV file containing customer records and are required to perform data processing and visualization tasks using Python libraries. Here's a concise summary of the tasks:
Data Processing 

Read the provided ACW Data using the CSV library.
Convert flat data structures into nested structures for Vehicle, Credit Card, and Address.
Correct errors in the 'dependants' column and print the problematic rows.
Write all records to a 'processed.json' file in JSON format.
Create 'retired.json' and 'employed.json' files for retired and employed customers.
Identify and write records with credit card issues to 'remove_ccard.json' using a custom function.
Calculate the 'Salary-Commute' attribute, sort records by this metric, and store in 'commute.json'.

Data Visualization 
Using Pandas and Seaborn, create various visualizations:

Calculate mean salary and median age from the data series of Salary and Age.
Perform univariate plots for Age, Dependents, and Age conditioned on Marital Status.
Create multivariate plots for Commuted distance vs. Salary, Age vs. Salary, and Age vs. Salary conditioned by Dependents.
Provide a Notebook cell to save the generated plots.
These tasks involve data processing, transformation, and visualization to help the client better understand their customer data.
